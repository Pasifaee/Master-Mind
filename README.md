# Master-Mind
A classic code-breaking game to play on your computer!
The game is all about guessing a short colour code generated by the computer in as few turns as you can. Each turn you will get a little information about the code â€“ your job is to obtain new information effectively and use it to finally break the code.

To play the game:
- download a Zip File of the repository (click "Code" button above the repository and then "Download ZIP")
- unpack the folder "Master Mind Game" on your computer
- open the "Master Mind" application (.exe file) and play the game!
